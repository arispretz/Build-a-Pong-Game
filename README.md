# Build-a-Pong-Game

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Legacy Data Visualization" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can control a paddle.

User Story: The computer can control the other paddle.

User Story: The computer's paddle is unbeatable. It should never miss the ball.

User Story: The game keeps track of the player and computer's score.
